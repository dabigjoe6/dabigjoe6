### Aspiring UX Engineer: Optimizing User Experience at every layer of abstraction

My passion for User experience stems from my love for optimization, optimizing existing systems and building new systems. My journey in software engineering is marked by a relentless pursuit of enhancing both performance and user satisfaction, regardless of the system layer. From the tangible user-interface down to the unseen backend-end services and infrastructure. 

I believe in the transformative power of optimization, whether it's making a UI more intuitive or streamlining backend operations for better performance.

I have experience writing software used by other software developers (including a robust UI component library and other dev-tools), a low-code tool for technical and non-technical end-users and various mobile and web applications.

I enjoy tinkering with every layer of abstraction of software as far as I am improving the user experience of the user from the perspective of speed and quality. This means I am willing to learn any tool; that is considerably the right tool for getting the job done.

I also enjoy implementing challenging user interfaces and bringing them to reality.

#### My current proficiency and software stack includes 
##### Frontend 
- Typescript, React, React Native, GraphQl
