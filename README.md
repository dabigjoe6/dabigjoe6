### UX Engineer: Optimizing User Experience at every layer of software abstraction

My passion for User experience stems from my love for optimization, optimizing existing systems and building new systems. My journey in software engineering is marked by a relentless pursuit of enhancing both performance and user satisfaction, regardless of the system layer. From the tangible user-interface down to the unseen backend-end services and infrastructure. 

As a User Experience Engineer, my primary goal is to optimize and enhance the user experience at every level of software development, ensuring both speed and quality. My expertise is not limited to front-end development; I also consider the user's needs when designing backend systems and infrastructure. Importantly, my users often include other software developers, for whom I create tools and systems that improve their efficiency and effectiveness in building user-centric applications.

I have experience working on a robust UI component library for a [Fortune 100](https://fortune.com/ranking/fortune500/) and other dev-tools, a low-code tool for technical and non-technical end-users and various mobile and web applications.

I enjoy tinkering with every layer of abstraction of software as far as I am improving the user experience of the user from the perspective of speed and quality. This means I am willing to learn **any** tool; that is considerably the right tool for getting the job done.

I also enjoy implementing challenging user interfaces and bringing them to reality.

#### My current proficiency and software stack includes
