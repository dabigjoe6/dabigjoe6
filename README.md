### UX Engineer: Optimizing User Experience at every layer of software abstraction

I am passionate about programming and optimizations, I aim to improve performance and user satisfaction across all layers of software, from the visible user interface to the underlying backend services and infrastructure.

As a User Experience Engineer, my primary goal is to optimize and enhance the user experience at every level of software development, ensuring both speed and quality. My expertise is not limited to front-end development; I also consider the user's needs when designing backend systems and infrastructure. Additionally, I have experience creating tools and systems for other software developers, aimed at improving their efficiency and effectiveness in building user-centric applications.

I have experience working on a robust UI component library and the Intranet of a [Fortune 100](https://fortune.com/ranking/fortune500/) with over 40,000 users. I have built and worked on dev-tools, a low-code tool for technical and non-technical end-users and various mobile and web applications.

I enjoy tinkering with every layer of abstraction of software as far as I am improving the user experience of the user from the perspective of speed and quality. This means I am willing to learn **any** tool; that is considerably the right tool for getting the job done.

I also enjoy implementing challenging user interfaces and bringing them to reality.
