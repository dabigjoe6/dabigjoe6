### Hello there,

I'm a recent Systems Engineering graduate with a passion for Software Engineering. 

I actively engage in fullstack development with React, Nodejs and React Native.

I'm currently learning blockchain development.

I enjoy building interactive motion animation on the Web with GSAP in my free time.

Sometimes I write technical articles on https://josepholabisi.medium.com
