### Hello there,

I'm a Systems Engineering Undergrad with a passion for Software Engineering. 

I actively engage in fullstack development with React, Nodejs and React Native.

I'm currently learning Web3 and solidity in building smart contracts and DeFi apps.  

I enjoy building interactive motion animation on the Web with GSAP in my free time. 

I'm also interested in Distributed Systems, Building Large Scale Software.

Sometimes I write technical articles on https://josepholabisi.medium.com
