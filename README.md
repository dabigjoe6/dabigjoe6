### Aspiring UX Engineer: Optimizing User Experience at every layer of abstraction

My passion for User experience stems from my love for optimization, I love the challenge of improving performance and user experience at any layer of a system. From the user-interface, network layer to backend-end services and infrastructure. 

I have experience writing software used by other software developers (including a robust UI component library and other dev-tools), a low-code tool for technical and non-technical end-users and various mobile and web applications.

I enjoy tinkering with every layer of abstraction of software as far as I am improving the user experience of the user from the perspective of speed and quality.

I enjoy implementing challenging user interfaces and bringing them to reality.

#### My current proficiency and software stack includes 
##### Frontend 
- Typescript, React, React Native, GraphQl
