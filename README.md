I am passionate about programming and optimizations, I aim to improve performance and user satisfaction across all layers of software, from the visible user interface to the underlying backend services and infrastructure.

I have experience working on a robust UI component library and the Intranet of a [Fortune 100](https://fortune.com/ranking/fortune500/) with over 40,000 users. I have built and worked on dev-tools, a low-code tool for technical and non-technical end-users and various mobile and web applications.

#### My current proficiency and software stack includes 
##### Frontend 
- Typescript, React, React Native, GraphQl
##### Backend
- Typescript, ExpressJS, Spring, Java
##### Infra & Others
- Kubernetes, Python, C++

I currently work as a Software Engineer at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/), outside of work I am working on the following side-projects - [Tnkr.ai](http://www.tnkr.ai/), [Synthesis](https://synthesisapp.com/)

I recently discovered a love for Graphics/Game engines, and I am slowly building this skillset in my free time.
